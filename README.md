Hey guys, its me, studios, so uhm. heres the (hastily made and uninformative) GUIDE for making a successful coal route:

1. Place truck stations near the coal mine and power plant (the more buildings the station is close too, the more coal it will generate)

2. Connect them with roads

3. Open the route menu, set the action to Wait For Load (you can press 3 to do this), then click on the coal mine's truck station

4. Set the action to Unload (you can press 4 to do this), then click on the power plant's truck station

5. Place a warehouse along the road, open the warehouse menu and click on the warehouse you just placed.

6. Set the warehouse's route to 1 (or the route id of the route you made)

7. Select the industrial goods truck, then buy one.

here comes the money!!! you should have 2 truck stations and roads connecting them, a warehouse, and trucks moving.
